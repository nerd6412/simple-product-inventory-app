# simple-product-inventory-app
Python program that creates a inventory file (if it does not exist) and allows the user to add, edit, delete, transact, and view product inventory. Data is saved even after exiting the program. Note that the 'transact' option is the only one that DOES NOT accept LOWERCASE letters. 'Purchase' means you will add to the current number of a specific product and 'Sold' means you subtract from it. Enjoy!
